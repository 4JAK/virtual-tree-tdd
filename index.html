        <h1>Code more efficiently with TDD</h1>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <h2>Clear Focus</h2>
                <p>
                    You're more productive while coding, and TDD helps keep that productivity high by narrowing your focus. It forces you to think about smaller chunks of functionality at a time rather than the application as a whole.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h2>Tidier Code</h2>
                <p>
                    Your tests are only interfacing with public methods, so you have a much better idea of what can be made private. You code more efficent and it reduces the chance of creating un-needed or redundant code.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h2>Fewer Bugs</h2>
                <p>
                    You save time down the line that would be spent fixing bugs that have popped up and need time to figure out. This also helps define what the bug actually is, as you always need reproducible steps.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h2>Living Documentation</h2>
                <p>
                    Tests can serve as documentation to a developer. Also you can see the expected inputs a method requires and what you can expect as outcome, all based on the assertions made in the test.
                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
